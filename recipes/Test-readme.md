[Data Prep Kit](https://github.com/IBM/data-prep-kit) is a community project to democratize and accelerate unstructured data preparation for LLM app developers. 
It offers implementations of commonly needed data preparation steps, called *modules* or *transforms*, for both Code and Language modalities, with vision to extend to images, 
speech and multimodal data. 

**Key Features at a Glance:**
- Supports both code and natural language modalities in a single framework
- 20+ data prep modules available out of the box, with more being added!
- Flexibility with various run times: Python, Ray, Spark, and KFP on Ray
- Scalable from a laptop to a full cluster, enabling smooth transitions from proof-of-concept (PoC) to production
